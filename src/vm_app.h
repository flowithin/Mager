/*
 * vm_map
 *
 * Ask for the lowest invalid virtual page in the process's arena to be
 * declared valid.  On success, vm_map returns the lowest address of the
 * new virtual page.  vm_map returns nullptr if the arena is full.
 *
 * If filename is nullptr, block is ignored, and the new virtual page is
 * backed by the swap file, is initialized to all zeroes, and is private
 * (i.e., not shared with any other virtual page).  In this case, vm_map
 * returns nullptr if the swap file is out of space.
 *
 * If filename is not nullptr, it points to a null-terminated C string that
 * specifies a file (the name of the file is specified relative to the pager's
 * current working directory).  In this case, the new virtual page is backed
 * by the specified file at the specified block and is shared with other virtual
 * pages that are mapped to that file and block.  The C string pointed to by
 * filename must reside completely in the valid portion of the arena.
 * In this case, vm_map returns nullptr if the C string pointed to by filename
 * is not completely in the valid part of the arena.
